\begin{abstract}
%Educational Robotics uses robotics as a teaching tool in middle and high schools, and undergraduate curricula. %and popularization of science. The goal is to use robotics for teaching a variety of subjects other than specifically robotics. To achieve this goal is vital to have an adequate interface that allows unexperienced students to interact with robots in an easy manner. In this paper we present the current development of ERBPI (\emph{Easy Robot Behaviour Programmign Interface}), a new application that doesn't require any previous programming experience to control robots. To accomplish this, we propose to abandon the imperative programming paradigm and take a behaviour-based approach. Thus, the new application is based on the connectionist paradigm. The idea is to program the behaviors of robots by establishing connections between its sensors and actuators. This connections may include different mathematical functions, making it possible to achieve complex behaviours. Moreover, different defined behaviours can be connected using a subsumission architecture. The new application is designed to work with a variety of real robots and simulators, and it is designed so that adding new robots and simulators is easy. Learning experiences with high school students allowed us to test its effectiveness.

To achieve this goal is vital to have an adequate interface that allows inexperienced students to interact with robots in an easy manner. In this paper we present the current development of ERBPI (\emph{Easy Robot Behaviour Programming Interface}), a new application that doesn't require any previous programming experience to control robots. To accomplish this, we propose to abandon the imperative programming paradigm and take a behaviour-based approach. Thus, the new application is based on the connectionist paradigm, accomplishing behaviours by establishing configurable connections between sensors and actuators. Moreover, different defined behaviours can be connected using a subsumption architecture. The new application is designed to work with different robots and simulators, and it is simple for adding new ones. Learning experiences with high school students allowed us to test its effectiveness.
